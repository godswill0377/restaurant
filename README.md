Restaurant owners worldwide can now freely download this amazing app for their smartphones and tablets to ease up the process of taking online orders. We have created the world’s simplest online food ordering system to be used by small and medium restaurants. This app transforms your smartphone or tablet into an order-receiving machine and streamlines your process of taking online orders for both pickup and delivery.

# How it works:
After you put the “Order Online” button on your website or your Facebook page your customers can place orders. You will be able to take all orders straight on your smartphone or tablet. This orders-taking app turns your smartphone or tablet into an order-receiving device and gives easier and better control over the order-taking process.

Each time a customer places an order via your website or your Facebook page, you will get an audio notification on your smartphone/tablet.

After clicking on the pending order, the tablet will display all relevant details concerning the order: customer details (name, phone number, address) and delivery details (address etc.).

You fill in the estimated time of order pickup or delivery, click accept and start cooking. Your customer will instantly receive an email with the confirmation of the order, together with the estimated time for pickup or delivery.
